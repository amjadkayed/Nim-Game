# How to play NIM GAME
The game consists of two versions

<h3>The first version is:</h3>
Given N rods in n (n=1) heights, two players, take turns
At each turn, the player has to select one heap and separate it into two different heaps having different number of rods
A player looses the game if he/she cannot select a height for separation.
Additional settings have been programmed for the game, such as the possibility of playing two players against each other and the possibility of playing one player against artificial intelligence with different difficulty levels.

<h3>The second version is</h3>
Two players take any number of matchsticks from one row alternately. The one, who takes the last matchstick loses.
Additional settings have been programmed for the game, such as the possibility of playing two players against each other and the possibility of playing one player against artificial intelligence with different difficulty levels.

The project was written using React, and it is worth noting that everything you see in this game is hand-drawn.
